# Deep Learning from Scratch


### Intro
This a learning project to reproduce the code examples as I read **Seth Weidman: 
Deep Learning from Scratch** book. I bought the Kindle copy through Amazon. 
I highly recommend the book to everyone who wants to have a lower level understanding of 
a neural network compared to high-performance deep learning libraries, e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch...etc.  
Besides Seth Weidman's code, I'm a big fan of **Joel Grus** and his books, repositories and youtube channel. 
Specifically, I implemented his **deep learning library called joelnet** on the boston dataset,
as I found his implementation simpler and more comprehensive.
