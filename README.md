# Deep Learning from Scratch

This is a learning project to reproduce the code examples as I read Seth Weidman's Deep Learning from Scratch book.

I bought the Kindle copy of the book through Amazon. I highly recommend the book to everyone who wants to have a lower level understanding of neural networks compared to high-performance deep learning libraries, e.g. Tensorflow, PyTorch...etc.
